It works and is sort of tested on Scandinavian text files, not on big scale though.

## TODO:
- Compiled signed version, so people don't have problems on company computers (Help needed!)

- Picking which file to open through commandpromt or a GUI file selection. (DONE)
- Encoding/regional characters not testet yet (works on a Scandinavian file so far).
- Filtering by keywords and alphabetical ordering. (TKinter UI is annoying on this one)
- Using/Reusing descriptions from central buildup files? (Ideas?)
- Collapse all
- Adding a new entry in a keynote file (DONE)
- Deleting entries in keynote file (DONE)
- Creating a new keynote file. (DONE)
