# OpenKeynote
An open source editor for Autodesk Revit(TM) keynote files.
Not affiliated with Autodesk!

##Status:
Well, it opens files.
GUI is sort of OK (through tkinter).
Current GUI: https://media.giphy.com/media/1rPVom2mOaRGV2nNMG/giphy.gif

##TODO (in prioritized order):
- Editing/saving options (Doh!)
- Picking which file to open through commandpromt or a GUI file selection.
  (the first one can be run from directly inside revit!)
- Encoding/regional characters not testet yet (works on a Scandinavian file so far).
- Filtering by keywords and alphabetical ordering.
- Using/Reusing descriptions from central buildup files?
- Collapse all
- Generally I'm open for all pythonic PEP inputs. This is my learning project!

Hours spent so far: 10
