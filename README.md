# OpenKeynote
An open source editor for Autodesk Revit(TM) keynote files.
Not affiliated with Autodesk!

##Status:
Well, it opens files.
GUI is sort of OK (through tkinter).

##TODO (in prioritized order):
- Editing/saving options (Doh!)
- Encoding/regional characters not testet yet (works on a Scandinavian file so far).
- Filtering by keywords and alphabetical ordering.
- Using/Reusing descriptions from central buildup files?
