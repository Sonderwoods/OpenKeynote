DISCLAIMER:
This program is provided as is, and no warranty provided if it corrupts
your keynote files. Always have a backup of the file you edit.

## Status:
Well, it opens files.
GUI is sort of scalable
Current GUI: https://media.giphy.com/media/1rPVom2mOaRGV2nNMG/giphy.gif
Open/Save dialog OK
Editing already existing keynote files OK

## TODO (in prioritized order):
- Autosave option
- Picking which file to open through commandpromt or a GUI file selection.
  (the first one can be run from directly inside revit!)
- Encoding/regional characters not testet yet (works on a Scandinavian file so far).
- Filtering by keywords and alphabetical ordering.
- Using/Reusing descriptions from central buildup files?
- Collapse all
- Generally I'm open for all pythonic PEP inputs. This is my learning project!
- Adding a new entry in a keynote file
- Deleting entries in keynote file
- Creating a new keynote file.

Hours spent so far: 30
